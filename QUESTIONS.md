# General Questions
- [ ] Do we want our variables to be constant, or should we implement getter/setters just in case? (i.e daily rate, max supply, etc)
- [ ] Should we implement a paymentsplitter into each contract to withdraw funds?

# Regarding 721A
- [ ] Do want a whitelist mint?
- [ ] How careful do we want the contract in terms of minting? Do we allow botters? Do we allow contract proxy mints? etc.
- [ ] Will we randomize metadata via contract or externally? (Latter is more gas efficient)

# Regarding Staking
- [ ] Do we want a minimum time limit to claim?
- [ ] What gimicks do we want? (i.e. pay lower taxes the longer time frame you unstake, etc)
